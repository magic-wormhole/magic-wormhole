        guarantee ordering: if Alice starts the process, then disconnects,
        then Bob starts (reading PAKE, sending both his PAKE and his VERSION
        phase), then Alice will see both PAKE and VERSION on her next
        connect, and might get the VERSION first.

        The Wormhole will queue inbound messages that it isn't ready for. The
        wormhole shim that lets applications do w.get(phase=) must do
        something similar, queueing inbound messages until it sees one for
        the phase it currently cares about.*/
