Greetings,

I'm gruntled to announce that magic-wormhole 0.15.0 is released.

Magic Wormhole is a Python library and CLI tool to securely get
arbitrary data from one computer to another using short, one-time,
human- pronouncable codes and end-to-end encryption.

The library allows use of the lower-level protocol for things besides
file-transfer.

In this release are the following changes since 0.14.0:

* Incorporate attrs' zope-interface support (#492, #527, from https://github.com/meejah)
* Add "codespell" to correct spelling (#526, from https://github.com/yarikoptic)
* Fix bash completions (#525, from https://github.com/RobertoD91)
* run tests properly when Noise is not installed (#522, from https://github.com/anarcat)

You can find the release on PyPI:

   https://pypi.org/project/magic-wormhole/
