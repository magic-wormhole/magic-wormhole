# The Magic-Wormhole API

This library provides a mechanism to securely transfer small amounts
of data between two computers. Both machines must be connected to the
internet, but they do not need to have public IP addresses or know how to
contact each other ahead of time.

Security and connectivity is provided by means of a "wormhole code": a short
string that is transcribed from one machine to the other by the users at the
keyboard. This works in conjunction with a baked-in "mailbox server" that
relays information from one machine to the other.

The "Wormhole" object provides a secure record pipe between any two programs
that use the same wormhole code (and are configured with the same application
ID and mailbox server). Each side can send multiple messages to the other,
but the encrypted data for all messages must pass through (and be temporarily
stored on) the mailbox server, which is a shared resource. For this
reason, larger data (including bulk file transfers) should use the Transit
class instead. The Wormhole can be used to create a Transit object for this
purpose. In the future, Transit will be deprecated, and this functionality
will be incorporated directly as a "dilated wormhole".

A quick example:

```python
import wormhole

async def example_initiator(reactor):
    w = wormhole.create(appid, relay_url, reactor)
    w.allocate_code()

    code = await w.get_code()
    print(f"code: {code}")

    w.send_message(b"outbound data")
    inbound = await w.get_message()
    await w.close()
```

## Modes

The API comes in two flavors: Delegated and Deferred. Controlling the
Wormhole and sending data is identical in both, but they differ in how
inbound data and events are delivered to the application.

In Delegated mode, the Wormhole is given a "delegate" object, on which
certain methods will be called when information is available (e.g. when the
code is established, or when data messages are received). In Deferred mode,
the Wormhole object has methods which return Deferreds that will fire at
these same times.

Delegated mode:

```python
class MyDelegate:
    def wormhole_got_code(self, code):
        print("code: %s" % code)
    def wormhole_got_message(self, msg): # called for each message
        print("got data, %d bytes" % len(msg))

w = wormhole.create(appid, relay_url, reactor, delegate=MyDelegate())
w.allocate_code()
```

Deferred mode:

```python
async def example_initiator(reactor):
    appid = "lothar.com/example"
    relay_url = public_relay.MAILBOX_RELAY
    w = wormhole.create(appid, relay_url, reactor)
    w.allocate_code()

    code = await w.get_code()
    print(f"code: {code}")

    msg = await w.get_message() # gets exactly one message
    print(f"got msg: {len(msg)} bytes")
    result = await w.close()
    print(f"closed: {result}")
```

## Application Identifier

Applications using this library must provide an "application identifier", a
simple string that distinguishes one application from another. To ensure
uniqueness, use a domain name. To use multiple apps for a single domain,
append a URL-like slash and path, like `example.com/app1`. This string must
be the same on both clients, otherwise they will not see each other. The
invitation codes are scoped to the app-id. Note that the app-id must be
unicode, not bytes.

Distinct app-ids reduce the size of the connection-id numbers. If fewer than
ten Wormholes are active for a given app-id, the connection-id will only need
to contain a single digit, even if some other app-id is currently using
thousands of concurrent sessions.

## Mailbox Servers

The library depends upon a "mailbox server" which is a service (on a
public IP address) that delivers small encrypted messages from one client to
the other. This must be the same for both clients, and is generally baked-in
to the application source code or default config.

This library includes the URL of a public mailbox server run by the
author. Application developers can use this one, or they can run their
own (see the [warner/magic-wormhole-mailbox-server
](https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole-mailbox-server) repository)
and configure their clients to use it instead. The URL of the public
mailbox server is passed as a unicode string. Note that because the
server actually speaks WebSockets, the URL starts with `ws:` (or
`wss:`) instead of `http:`.

## Wormhole Parameters

All wormholes must be created with at least three parameters:

* `appid`: a (unicode) string
* `relay_url`: a (unicode) string
* `reactor`: the Twisted reactor object

In addition to these three, the `wormhole.create()` function takes several
optional arguments:

* `delegate`: provide a Delegate object to enable "delegated mode", or pass
  None (the default) to get "deferred mode"
* `journal`: provide a Journal object to enable journaled mode. See
  journal.md for details. Note that journals only work with delegated mode,
  not with deferred mode.
* `tor_manager`: to enable Tor support, create a `wormhole.TorManager`
  instance and pass it here. This will hide the client's IP address by
  proxying all connections (mailbox and transit) through Tor. It also
  enables connecting to Onion-service transit hints, and (in the future) will
  enable the creation of Onion-services for transit purposes.
* `timing`: this accepts a DebugTiming instance, mostly for internal
  diagnostic purposes, to record the transmit/receive timestamps for all
  messages. The `wormhole --dump-timing=` feature uses this to build a
  JSON-format data bundle, and the `misc/dump-timing.py` tool can build a
  scrollable timing diagram from these bundles.
* `welcome_handler`: this is a function that will be called when the
  Mailbox Server's "welcome" message is received. It is used to display
  important server messages in an application-specific way.
* `versions`: this can accept a dictionary (JSON-encodable) of data that will
  be made available to the peer via the `got_version` event. This data is
  delivered before any data messages, and can be used to indicate peer
  capabilities.

## Code Management

Each wormhole connection is defined by a shared secret "wormhole code". These
codes can be created by humans offline (by picking a unique number and some
secret words), but are more commonly generated by asking the library to make
one. In the "bin/wormhole" file-transfer tool, the default behavior is for
the sender's program to create the code, and for the receiver to type it in.

The code is a (unicode) string in the form `NNN-code-words`. The numeric
"NNN" prefix is the "channel id" or "nameplate", and is a short integer
allocated by talking to the mailbox server. The rest is a
randomly-generated selection from the PGP wordlist, providing a default of 16
bits of entropy. The initiating program should display this code to the user,
who should transcribe it to the receiving user, who gives it to their local
Wormhole object by calling `set_code()`. The receiving program can also use
`input_code()` to use a readline-based input function: this offers tab
completion of allocated channel-ids and known codewords.

The Wormhole object has three APIs for generating or accepting a code:

* `w.allocate_code(length=2)`: this contacts the Mailbox Server, allocates
  a short numeric nameplate, chooses a configurable number of random words,
  then assembles them into the code
* `w.set_code(code)`: this accepts the complete code as an argument
* `helper = w.input_code()`: this facilitates interactive entry of the code,
  with tab-completion. The helper object has methods to return a list of
  viable completions for whatever portion of the code has been entered so
  far. A convenience wrapper is provided to attach this to the `rlcompleter`
  function of libreadline.

No matter which mode is used, the `w.get_code()` Deferred (or
`delegate.wormhole_got_code(code)` callback) will fire when the code is
known. `get_code` is clearly necessary for `allocate_code`, since there's no
other way to learn what code was created, but it may be useful in other modes
for consistency.

The code-entry Helper object has the following API:

* `refresh_nameplates()`: requests an updated list of nameplates from the
  Mailbox Server. These form the first portion of the wormhole code (e.g.
  "4" in "4-purple-sausages"). Note that they are unicode strings (so "4",
  not 4). The Helper will get the response in the background, and calls to
  `get_nameplate_completions()` after the response will use the new list.
  Calling this after `h.choose_nameplate` will raise
  `AlreadyChoseNameplateError`.
* `matches = h.get_nameplate_completions(prefix)`: returns (synchronously) a
  set of completions for the given nameplate prefix, along with the hyphen
  that always follows the nameplate (and separates the nameplate from the
  rest of the code). For example, if the server reports nameplates 1, 12, 13,
  24, and 170 are in use, `get_nameplate_completions("1")` will return
  `{"1-", "12-", "13-", "170-"}`. You may want to sort these before
  displaying them to the user. Raises `AlreadyChoseNameplateError` if called
  after `h.choose_nameplate`.
* `h.choose_nameplate(nameplate)`: accepts a string with the chosen
  nameplate. May only be called once, after which
  `AlreadyChoseNameplateError` is raised. (in this future, this might
  return a Deferred that fires (with None) when the nameplate's wordlist is
  known (which happens after the nameplate is claimed, requiring a roundtrip
  to the server)).
* `d = h.when_wordlist_is_available()`: return a Deferred that fires (with
  None) when the wordlist is known. This can be used to block a readline
  frontend which has just called `h.choose_nameplate()` until the resulting
  wordlist is known, which can improve the tab-completion behavior.
* `matches = h.get_word_completions(prefix)`: return (synchronously) a set of
  completions for the given words prefix. This will include a trailing hyphen
  if more words are expected. The possible completions depend upon the
  wordlist in use for the previously-claimed nameplate, so calling this
  before `choose_nameplate` will raise `MustChooseNameplateFirstError`.
  Calling this after `h.choose_words()` will raise `AlreadyChoseWordsError`.
  Given a prefix like "su", this returns a set of strings which are potential
  matches (e.g. `{"supportive-", "surrender-", "suspicious-"}`. The prefix
  should not include the nameplate, but *should* include whatever words and
  hyphens have been typed so far (the default wordlist uses alternate lists,
  where even numbered words have three syllables, and odd numbered words have
  two, so the completions depend upon how many words are present, not just
  the partial last word). E.g. `get_word_completions("pr")` will return
  `{"processor-", "provincial-", "proximate-"}`, while
  `get_word_completions("opulent-pr")` will return `{"opulent-preclude",
  "opulent-prefer", "opulent-preshrunk", "opulent-printer",
  "opulent-prowler"}` (note the lack of a trailing hyphen, because the
  wordlist is expecting a code of length two). If the wordlist is not yet
  known, this returns an empty set. All return values will
  `.startswith(prefix)`. The frontend is responsible for sorting the results
  before display.
* `h.choose_words(words)`: call this when the user is finished typing in the
  code. It does not return anything, but will cause the Wormhole's
  `w.get_code()` (or corresponding delegate) to fire, and triggers the
  wormhole connection process. This accepts a string like "purple-sausages",
  without the nameplate. It must be called after `h.choose_nameplate()` or
  `MustChooseNameplateFirstError` will be raised. May only be called once,
  after which `AlreadyChoseWordsError` is raised.

The `input_with_completion` wrapper is a function that knows how to use the
code-entry helper to do tab completion of wormhole codes:

```python
from wormhole import create, input_with_completion

async def example(reactor):
    w = create(appid, relay_url, reactor)
    input_with_completion("Wormhole code:", w.input_code(), reactor)
    code = await w.get_code()
```

This helper runs python's (raw) `input()` function inside a thread, since
`input()` normally blocks.

The two machines participating in the wormhole setup are not distinguished:
it doesn't matter which one goes first, and both use the same Wormhole
constructor function. However if `w.allocate_code()` is used, only one side
should use it.

Providing an invalid nameplate (which is easily caused by cut-and-paste
errors that include an extra space at the beginning, or which copy the words
but not the number) will raise a `KeyFormatError`, either in
`w.set_code(code)` or in `h.choose_nameplate()`.

## Offline Codes

In most situations, the "sending" or "initiating" side will call
`w.allocate_code()` and display the resulting code. The sending human reads
it and speaks, types, performs charades, or otherwise transmits the code to
the receiving human. The receiving human then types it into the receiving
computer, where it either calls `w.set_code()` (if the code is passed in via
argv) or `w.input_code()` (for interactive entry).

Usually one machine generates the code, and a pair of humans transcribes it
to the second machine (so `w.allocate_code()` on one side, and `w.set_code()`
or `w.input_code()` on the other). But it is also possible for the humans to
generate the code offline, perhaps at a face-to-face meeting, and then take
the code back to their computers. In this case, `w.set_code()` will be used
on both sides. It is unlikely that the humans will restrict themselves to a
pre-established wordlist when manually generating codes, so the completion
feature of `w.input_code()` is not helpful.

When the humans create an invitation code out-of-band, they are responsible
for choosing an unused channel-ID (simply picking a random 3-or-more digit
number is probably enough), and some random words. Dice, coin flips, shuffled
cards, or repeated sampling of a high-resolution stopwatch are all useful
techniques. The invitation code uses the same format either way: channel-ID,
a hyphen, and an arbitrary string. There is no need to encode the sampled
random values (e.g. by using the Diceware wordlist) unless that makes it
easier to transcribe: e.g. rolling 6 dice could result in a code like
"913-166532", and flipping 16 coins could result in "123-HTTHHHTTHTTHHTHH".

## Welcome Messages

The first message sent by the mailbox server is a "welcome" message (a
dictionary). This is sent as soon as the client connects to the server,
generally before the code is established. Clients should use
`await get_welcome()` to get and process the `motd` key (and maybe
`current_cli_version`) inside the welcome message.

The welcome message serves three main purposes:

* notify users about important server changes, such as CAPTCHA requirements
  driven by overload, or donation requests
* enable future protocol negotiation between clients and the server
* advise users of the CLI tools (`wormhole send`) to upgrade to a new version

There are three keys currently defined for the welcome message, all of which
are optional (the welcome message omits "error" and "motd" unless the server
operator needs to signal a problem).

* `motd`: if this key is present, it will be a string with embedded newlines.
  The client should display this string to the user, including a note that it
  comes from the magic-wormhole Mailbox Server and that server's URL.
* `error`: if present, the server has decided it cannot service this client.
  The string will be wrapped in a `WelcomeError` (which is a subclass of
  `WormholeError`), and all API calls will signal errors (pending Deferreds
  will errback). The mailbox connection will be closed.
* `current_cli_version`: if present, the server is advising instances of the
  CLI tools (the `wormhole` command included in the python distribution) that
  there is a newer release available, thus users should upgrade if they can,
  because more features will be available if both clients are running the
  same version. The CLI tools compare this string against their `__version__`
  and can print a short message to stderr if an upgrade is warranted.

The main idea of `error` is to allow the server to cleanly inform the client
about some necessary action it didn't take. The server currently sends the
welcome message as soon as the client connects (even before it receives the
"claim" request), but a future server could wait for a required client
message and signal an error (via the Welcome message) if it didn't see this
extra message before the CLAIM arrived.

This could enable changes to the protocol, e.g. requiring a CAPTCHA or
proof-of-work token when the server is under DoS attack. The new server would
send the current requirements in an initial message (which old clients would
ignore). New clients would be required to send the token before their "claim"
message. If the server sees "claim" before "token", it knows that the client
is too old to know about this protocol, and it could send a "welcome" with an
`error` field containing instructions (explaining to the user that the server
is under attack, and they must either upgrade to a client that can speak the
new protocol, or wait until the attack has passed). Either case is better
than an opaque exception later when the required message fails to arrive.

(Note that the server can also send an explicit ERROR message at any time,
and the client should react with a ServerError. Versions 0.9.2 and earlier of
the library did not pay attention to the ERROR message, hence the server
should deliver errors in a WELCOME message if at all possible)

The `error` field is handled internally by the Wormhole object. The other
fields can be processed by application, by using `d=w.get_welcome()`. The
Deferred will fire with the full welcome dictionary, so any other keys that a
future server might send will be available to it.

Applications which need to display `motd` or an upgrade message, and wish to
do so before using stdin/stdout for interactive code entry (`w.input_code()`)
should wait for `get_welcome()` before starting the entry process:

```python
async def go():
    w = wormhole.create(appid, relay_url, reactor)
    welcome = await w.get_welcome()
    if "motd" in welcome:
        print(welcome["motd"])
    input_with_completion("Wormhole code:", w.input_code(), reactor)
    ...
```

## Verifier

For extra protection against guessing attacks, Wormhole can provide a
"Verifier". This is a moderate-length series of bytes (a SHA256 hash) that is
derived from the supposedly-shared session key. If desired, both sides can
display this value, and the humans can manually compare them before allowing
the rest of the protocol to proceed. If they do not match, then the two
programs are not talking to each other (they may both be talking to a
man-in-the-middle attacker), and the protocol should be abandoned.

Deferred-mode applications can wait for `d=w.get_verifier()`: the Deferred
it returns will fire with the verifier. You can turn this into hex or Base64
to print it, or render it as ASCII-art, etc.

Asking the wormhole object for the verifier does not affect the flow of the
protocol. To benefit from verification, applications must refrain from
sending any data (with `w.send_message(data)`) until after the verifiers are
approved by the user. In addition, applications must queue or otherwise
ignore incoming (received) messages until that point. However once the
verifiers are confirmed, previously-received messages can be considered valid
and processed as usual.

## Events

As the wormhole connection is established, several events may be dispatched
to the application. In Delegated mode, these are dispatched by calling
functions on the delegate object. In Deferred mode, the application retrieves
Deferred objects from the wormhole, and event dispatch is performed by firing
those Deferreds.

Most applications will only use `code`, `received`, and `close`.

* code (`code = yield w.get_code()` / `dg.wormhole_got_code(code)`): fired
  when the wormhole code is established, either after `w.allocate_code()`
  finishes the generation process, or when the Input Helper returned by
  `w.input_code()` has been told `h.set_words()`, or immediately after
  `w.set_code(code)` is called. This is most useful after calling
  `w.allocate_code()`, to show the generated code to the user so they can
  transcribe it to their peer.
* key (`yield w.get_unverified_key()` /
  `dg.wormhole_got_unverified_key(key)`): fired (with the raw master SPAKE2
  key) when the key-exchange process has completed and a purported shared key
  is established. At this point we do not know that anyone else actually
  shares this key: the peer may have used the wrong code, or may have
  disappeared altogether. To wait for proof that the key is shared, wait for
  `get_verifier` instead. This event is really only useful for detecting that
  the initiating peer has disconnected after leaving the initial PAKE
  message, to display a pacifying message to the user.
* verifier (`verifier = yield w.get_verifier()` /
  `dg.wormhole_got_verifier(verifier)`: fired when the key-exchange process
  has completed and a valid VERSION message has arrived. The "verifier" is a
  byte string with a hash of the shared session key; clients can compare them
  (probably as hex) to ensure that they're really talking to each other, and
  not to a man-in-the-middle. When `get_verifier` happens, this side knows
  that *someone* has used the correct wormhole code; if someone used the
  wrong code, the VERSION message cannot be decrypted, and the wormhole will
  be closed instead.
* versions (`versions = yield w.get_versions()` /
  `dg.wormhole_got_versions(versions)`: fired when the VERSION message
  arrives from the peer. This fires just after `verified`, but delivers the
  "app_versions" data (as passed into `wormhole.create(versions=)`) instead
  of the verifier string. This is mostly a hack to make room for
  forwards-compatible changes to the CLI file-transfer protocol, which sends
  a request in the first message (rather than merely sending the abilities of
  each side).
* received (`yield w.get_message()` / `dg.wormhole_got_message(msg)`: fired
  each time a data message arrives from the peer, with the bytestring that
  the peer passed into `w.send_message(msg)`. This is the primary
  data-transfer API.
* closed (`yield w.close()` / `dg.wormhole_closed(result)`: fired when
  `w.close()` has finished shutting down the wormhole, which means all
  nameplates and mailboxes have been deallocated, and the WebSocket
  connection has been closed. This also fires if an internal error occurs
  (specifically WrongPasswordError, which indicates that an invalid encrypted
  message was received), which also shuts everything down. The `result` value
  is an exception (or Failure) object if the wormhole closed badly, or a
  string like "happy" if it had no problems before shutdown.

## Sending Data

The main purpose of a Wormhole is to send data. At any point after
construction, callers can invoke `w.send_message(msg)`. This will queue the
message if necessary, but (if all goes well) will eventually result in the
peer getting a `received` event and the data being delivered to the
application.

Since Wormhole provides an ordered record pipe, each call to `w.send_message`
will result in exactly one `received` event on the far side. Records are not
split, merged, dropped, or reordered.

Each side can do an arbitrary number of `send_message()` calls. The Wormhole
is not meant as a long-term communication channel, but some protocols work
better if they can exchange an initial pair of messages (perhaps offering
some set of negotiable capabilities), and then follow up with a second pair
(to reveal the results of the negotiation). The Mailbox Server does not
currently enforce any particular limits on number of messages, size of
messages, or rate of transmission, but in general clients are expected to
send fewer than a dozen messages, of no more than perhaps 20kB in size
(remember that all these messages are temporarily stored in a SQLite database
on the server). A future version of the protocol may make these limits more
explicit, and will allow clients to ask for greater capacity when they
connect (probably by passing additional "mailbox attribute" parameters with
the `allocate`/`claim`/`open` messages).

For bulk data transfer, see "transit.md", or the "Dilation" section below.

## Closing

When the application is done with the wormhole, it should call `w.close()`,
and wait for a `closed` event. This ensures that all server-side resources
are released (allowing the nameplate to be re-used by some other client), and
all network sockets are shut down.

In Deferred mode, this just means waiting for the Deferred returned by
`w.close()` to fire. In Delegated mode, this means calling `w.close()` (which
doesn't return anything) and waiting for the delegate's `wormhole_closed()`
method to be called.

`w.close()` will errback (with some form of `WormholeError`) if anything went
wrong with the process, such as:

* `WelcomeError`: the server told us to signal an error, probably because the
  client is too old understand some new protocol feature
* `ServerError`: the server rejected something we did
* `LonelyError`: we didn't hear from the other side, so no key was
  established
* `WrongPasswordError`: we received at least one incorrectly-encrypted
  message. This probably indicates that the other side used a different
  wormhole code than we did, perhaps because of a typo, or maybe an attacker
  tried to guess your code and failed.

If the wormhole was happy at the time it was closed, the `w.close()` Deferred
will callback (probably with the string "happy", but this may change in the
future).

## Serialization

(NOTE: this section is speculative: this code has not yet been written)

Wormhole objects can be serialized. This can be useful for apps which save
their own state before shutdown, and restore it when they next start up
again.


The `w.serialize()` method returns a dictionary which can be JSON encoded
into a unicode string (most applications will probably want to UTF-8 -encode
this into a bytestring before saving on disk somewhere).

To restore a Wormhole, call `wormhole.from_serialized(data, reactor,
delegate)`. This will return a wormhole in roughly the same state as was
serialized (of course all the network connections will be disconnected).

Serialization only works for delegated-mode wormholes (since Deferreds point
at functions, which cannot be serialized easily). It also only works for
"non-dilated" wormholes (see below).

To ensure correct behavior, serialization should probably only be done in
"journaled mode". See journal.md for details.

If you use serialization, be careful to never use the same partial wormhole
object twice.

## Dilation

(NOTE: this API is still in development)

To send bulk data, or anything more than a handful of messages, a Wormhole
can be "dilated" into a form that uses a direct TCP connection between the
two endpoints.

All wormholes start out "undilated". In this state, all messages are queued
on the Mailbox Server for the lifetime of the wormhole, and server-imposed
number/size/rate limits apply. Calling `w.dilate()` initiates the dilation
process, and eventually yields a set of Endpoints. Once dilated these endpoints
can be used to establish multiple (encrypted) "subchannel" connections to the
other side.

Each subchannel behaves like a regular Twisted `ITransport`, so they can be
glued to the Protocol instance of your choice. They also implement the
IConsumer/IProducer interfaces.

These subchannels are *durable*: as long as the processes on both sides keep
running, the subchannel will survive the network connection being dropped.
For example, a file transfer can be started from a laptop, then while it is
running, the laptop can be closed, moved to a new wifi network, opened back
up, and the transfer will resume from the new IP address.

What's good about a non-dilated wormhole?:

* setup is faster: no delay while it tries to make a direct connection
* works with "journaled mode", allowing progress to be made even when both
  sides are never online at the same time, by serializing the wormhole

What's good about dilated wormholes?:

* they support bulk data transfer
* you get flow control (backpressure), and IProducer/IConsumer
* throughput is faster: no store-and-forward step

Use non-dilated wormholes when your application only needs to exchange a
couple of messages, for example to set up public keys or provision access
tokens. Use a dilated wormhole to move files, stream data, etc

Dilated wormholes can provide multiple "subchannels": these are multiplexed
through the single (encrypted) TCP connection. Each subchannel is a separate
stream (offering IProducer/IConsumer for flow control), and is opened and
closed independently. A special "control channel" is available to both sides
so they can coordinate how they use the subchannels.

The `d = w.dilate()` Deferred fires with a triple of Endpoints:

```python
d = w.dilate()
def _dilated(res):
    (control_channel_ep, subchannel_client_ep, subchannel_server_ep) = res
d.addCallback(_dilated)
```

The `control_channel_ep` endpoint is a client-style endpoint, so both sides
will connect to it with `ep.connect(factory)`. This endpoint is single-use:
calling `.connect()` a second time will fail. The control channel is
symmetric: it doesn't matter which side is the application-level
client/server or initiator/responder, if the application even has such
concepts. The two applications can use the control channel to negotiate who
goes first, if necessary.

The subchannel endpoints are *not* symmetric: for each subchannel, one side
must listen as a server, and the other must connect as a client. Subchannels
can be established by either side at any time. This supports e.g.
bidirectional file transfer, where either user of a GUI app can drop files
into the "wormhole" whenever they like.

The `subchannel_client_ep` on one side is used to connect to the other side's
`subchannel_server_ep`, and vice versa. The client endpoint is reusable. The
server endpoint is single-use: `.listen(factory)` may only be called once.

Applications are under no obligation to use subchannels: for many use cases,
the control channel is enough.

To use subchannels, once the wormhole is dilated and the endpoints are
available, the listening-side application should attach a listener to the
`subchannel_server_ep` endpoint:

```python
def _dilated(res):
    (control_channel_ep, subchannel_client_ep, subchannel_server_ep) = res
    f = Factory(MyListeningProtocol)
    subchannel_server_ep.listen(f)
```

When the connecting-side application wants to connect to that listening
protocol, it should use `.connect()` with a suitable connecting protocol
factory:

```python
def _connect():
    f = Factory(MyConnectingProtocol)
    subchannel_client_ep.connect(f)
```

For a bidirectional file-transfer application, both sides will establish a
listening protocol. Later, if/when the user drops a file on the application
window, that side will initiate a connection, use the resulting subchannel to
transfer the single file, and then close the subchannel.

```python
def FileSendingProtocol(internet.Protocol):
    def __init__(self, metadata, filename):
        self.file_metadata = metadata
        self.file_name = filename
    def connectionMade(self):
        self.transport.write(self.file_metadata)
        sender = protocols.basic.FileSender()
        f = open(self.file_name,"rb")
        d = sender.beginFileTransfer(f, self.transport)
        d.addBoth(self._done, f)
    def _done(res, f):
        self.transport.loseConnection()
        f.close()
def _send(metadata, filename):
    f = protocol.ClientCreator(reactor,
                               FileSendingProtocol, metadata, filename)
    subchannel_client_ep.connect(f)
def FileReceivingProtocol(internet.Protocol):
    state = INITIAL
    def dataReceived(self, data):
        if state == INITIAL:
            self.state = DATA
            metadata = parse(data)
            self.f = open(metadata.filename, "wb")
        else:
            # local file writes are blocking, so don't bother with IConsumer
            self.f.write(data)
    def connectionLost(self, reason):
        self.f.close()
def _dilated(res):
    (control_channel_ep, subchannel_client_ep, subchannel_server_ep) = res
    f = Factory(FileReceivingProtocol)
    subchannel_server_ep.listen(f)
```

## Bytes, Strings, Unicode, and Python 3

All cryptographically-sensitive parameters are passed as bytes ("str" in
python2, "bytes" in python3):

* verifier string
* data in/out
* transit records in/out

Other (human-facing) values are always unicode ("unicode" in python2, "str"
in python3):

* wormhole code
* relay URL
* transit URLs
* transit connection hints (e.g. "host:port")
* application identifier
* derived-key "purpose" string: `w.derive_key(PURPOSE, LENGTH)`
