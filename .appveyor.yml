environment:
  # we tell Tox to use "twisted[windows]", to get pypiwin32 installed
  #TWISTED_EXTRAS: "[windows]"
  # that didn't work (it seems to work when I run it locally, but on appveyor
  # it fails to install the pypiwin32 package). So don't bother telling
  # Twisted to support windows: just install it ourselves.
  # EXTRA_DEPENDENCY: "pypiwin32"
  matrix:
    # For Python versions available on Appveyor, see

# note:
# %PYTHON% has: python.exe
# %PYTHON%\Scripts has: pip.exe, tox.exe (and others installed by bare pip)


build: off

test_script:
  # Put your test command here.
  # Note that you must use the environment variable %PYTHON% to refer to
  # the interpreter you're using - Appveyor does not do anything special
  # to put the Python version you want to use on PATH.

after_test:
  # This step builds your wheels.
  # Again, you only need build.cmd if you're building C extensions for
  # 64-bit Python 3.3/3.4. And you need to use %PYTHON% to get the correct
  # interpreter

artifacts:
  # bdist_wheel puts your built wheel in the dist directory
  - path: dist\*

#on_success:
#  You can use this step to upload your artifacts to a public website.
#  See Appveyor's documentation for more details. Or you can simply
#  access your wheels from the Appveyor "artifacts" tab for your build.
