# tox-2.3.1 has a windows bug (#314), fixed in hg but not yet released. When
# the next release comes out, replace this with just:
#   %PYTHON%\python.exe -m pip install wheel tox

install:
  - |
    %PYTHON%\python.exe -m pip install -U pip virtualenv
    %PYTHON%\python.exe -m pip install wheel "hg+https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/tox#egg=tox"

# note:
# %PYTHON% has: python.exe
# %PYTHON%\Scripts has: pip.exe, tox.exe (and others installed by bare pip)


build: off

test_script:
  # Put your test command here.
  # Note that you must use the environment variable %PYTHON% to refer to
  # the interpreter you're using - Appveyor does not do anything special
  # to put the Python evrsion you want to use on PATH.
  - |
    misc\windows-build.cmd %PYTHON%\Scripts\tox.exe -e py

after_test:
  # This step builds your wheels.
  # Again, you only need build.cmd if you're building C extensions for
  # 64-bit Python 3.3/3.4. And you need to use %PYTHON% to get the correct
  # interpreter
  - |
    misc\windows-build.cmd %PYTHON%\python.exe setup.py bdist_wheel

artifacts:
  # bdist_wheel puts your built wheel in the dist directory
  - path: dist\*

#on_success:
#  You can use this step to upload your artifacts to a public website.
#  See Appveyor's documentation for more details. Or you can simply
#  access your wheels from the Appveyor "artifacts" tab for your build.
