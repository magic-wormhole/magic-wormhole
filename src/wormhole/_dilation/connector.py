    The Manager creates one of me at a time, whenever it wants a connection
    (which is always, once w.dilate() has been called and we know the remote
    end can dilate, and is expressed by the Manager calling my .start()
    method). I am discarded when my established connection is lost (and if we
    still want to be connected, a new generation is started and a new
    Connector is created). I am also discarded if we stop wanting to be
    connected (which the Manager expresses by calling my .stop() method).

    I manage the race between multiple connections for a specific generation
    of the dilated connection.

    I send connection hints when my InboundConnectionFactory yields addresses
    (self.listener_ready), and I initiate outbond connections (with
    OutboundConnectionFactory) as I receive connection hints from my peer
    (self.got_hints). Both factories use my build_protocol() method to create
    connection.DilatedConnectionProtocol instances. I track these protocol
    instances until one finishes negotiation and wins the race. I then shut
    down the others, remember the winner as self._winning_connection, and
    deliver the winner to manager.connector_connection_made(c).

    When an active connection is lost, we call manager.connector_connection_lost,
    allowing the manager to decide whether it wants to start a new generation
