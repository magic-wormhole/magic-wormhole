PyPI no longer accepts signatures for uploaded packages.

This directory contains detached signatures for assets found on PyPI.

These signatures SHOULD VERIFY against the corresponding assets from PyPI.

"meejah" and "warner" are both valid release signers (and both have
the ability to upload to PyPI).
