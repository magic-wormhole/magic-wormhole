# use pyinstaller to build a single-file "fat binary" called wormhole.exe.
#
# the .exe here does NOT mean a windows executable, but an executable in general.
#
# "fat binary" means it includes the python interpreter, the python source code
# and libs, compiled code parts and externally needed (C/compiled) libraries.
# it does NOT include the (g)libc though as this needs to be provided by the
# target platform and needs to match the kernel there. thus, it is a good idea
# to run the build on an old, but still security-supported linux (or other posix
# OS) to keep the minimum (g)libc requirement low.

pyinstaller --clean --distpath=dist wormhole.exe.spec

# result will be in dist/wormhole.exe
