version: master
summary: get things from one computer to another, safely
description: |
  This package provides a library and a command-line tool named wormhole,
  which makes it possible to get short pieces of text (and arbitrary-sized
  files and directories) from one computer to another. The two endpoints are
  identified by using identical "wormhole codes": in general, the sending
  machine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into the
  receiving machine.
  The codes are short and human-pronounceable, using a phonetically-distinct
  wordlist. The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords, so
  usually only a few characters must be typed. Wormhole codes are single-use
  and do not need to be memorized.
