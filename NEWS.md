User-visible changes in "magic-wormhole":

## Release ?? (??)

* Arrange for 0.4.0 senders to print an error message when connecting to a
  current (0.5.0) server, instead of an ugly stack trace. Unfortunately 0.4.0
  receivers still display the traceback, since they don't check the welcome
  message before using a missing API.

## Release 0.5.0 (07-Oct-2015)

* Change the CLI to merge send-file with send-text, and receive-file with
  receive-text. Add confirmation before accepting a file.
* Change the remote server API significantly, breaking compatibility with
  0.4.0 peers. Fix EventSource to match W3C spec and real browser behavior.
* Add py3 (3.3, 3.4, 3.5) compatibility for blocking calls (but not Twisted).
* internals
 * Introduce Channel and ChannelManager to factor out the HTTP/EventSource
   technology in use (making room for WebSocket or Tor in the future).
 * Change app-visible API to allow multiple message phases.
 * Change most API arguments from bytes to unicode strings (appid, URLs,
   wormhole code, derive_key purpose string, message phase). Derived keys are
   bytes, of course.
* Add proper unit tests.

## Release 0.4.0 (22-Sep-2015)

This changes the protocol (to a symmetric form), breaking compatibility with
0.3.0 peers. Now both blocking-style and Twisted-style use a symmetric
protocol, and the two sides do not need to figure out (ahead of time) which
one goes first. The internal layout was rearranged, so applications that
import wormhole must be updated.

## Release 0.3.0 (24-Jun-2015)

Add preliminary Twisted support, only for symmetric endpoints (no
initator/receiver distinction). Lacks code-entry tab-completion. May still
leave timers lingering. Add test suite (only for Twisted, so far).

Use a sqlite database for Relay server state, to survive reboots with less
data loss. Add "--advertise-version=" to "wormhole relay start", to override
the version we recommend to clients.

## Release 0.2.0 (10-Apr-2015)

Initial release: supports blocking/synchronous asymmetric endpoints
(Initiator on one side, Receiver on the other). Codes can be generated by
Initiator, or created externally and passed into both (as long as they start
with digits: NNN-anything).
