# on windows, trial is installed as venv/bin/trial.py, not .exe, but (at
# least appveyor) adds .PY to $PATHEXT. So "trial wormhole" might work on
# windows, and certainly does on unix. But to get "coverage run" to work, we
# need a script name (since "python -m twisted.scripts.trial" doesn't have a
# 'if __name__ == "__main__": run()' -style clause), and the script name will
# vary on the platform. So we added a small class (wormhole.test.run_trial)
# that does the right import for us.
