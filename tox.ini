# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

# on windows, trial is installed as venv/bin/trial.py, not .exe, but (at
# least appveyor) adds .PY to $PATHEXT. So "trial wormhole" might work on
# windows, and certainly does on unix. To get "coverage run" to work, we need
# a script name (since "python -m twisted.scripts.trial" doesn't have a 'if
# __name__ == "__main__": run()' -style clause). The script name will vary on
# the platform.
